  abstract = {We consider a directed random walk on the backbone of the infinite cluster gener-
ated by supercritical oriented percolation, or equivalently the space-time embedding
of the “ancestral lineage” of an individual in the stationary discrete-time contact pro-
cess. We prove a law of large numbers and an annealed central limit theorem (i.e.,
averaged over the realisations of the cluster) using a regeneration approach. Fur-
thermore, we obtain a quenched central limit theorem (i.e. for almost any realisation
of the cluster) via an analysis of joint renewals of two independent walks on the same
cluster.},

@article{birkner2016random,
  abstract = {We consider random walks in dynamic random environments, with an environment
generated by the time-reversal of a Markov process from the oriented percolation
universality class. If the influence of the random medium on the walk is small in
space-time regions where the medium is typical, we obtain a law of large numbers
and an averaged central limit theorem for the walk via a regeneration construction
under suitable coarse-graining.
Such random walks occur naturally as spatial embeddings of ancestral lineages in
spatial population models with local regulation. We verify that our assumptions hold
for logistic branching random walks when the population density is sufficiently high.},
