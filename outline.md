1. Introduction: motivation

2. Outline of results

    - temporal correlation
    - description of {Markov, Brownian} environment results
    - monotonicity of sigma[e] with space/time correlations

3. Markov world

    - sigma[e] > sigma if p + q > 1, ie. if spatial correlations negative
    - sigma[e] goes down as temporal correlations go up 

4. Brownian bubbleworld

    - Glauber dynamics converging to Brownian bubbles (proof in appendix)
    - lineage convergence in this situation (proof in appendix)
    - calculations of sigma[e]

        * dependence on temporal correlations (cluster birth/death)
        * dependence on spatial correlations (sigma of the boundary?)

5. R2: discussion, simulations
