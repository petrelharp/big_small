The tentative plan here:

1. make a spatial simulation with biased dispersal
2. make plots of lineages going "uphill"
3. make heatmaps of the stationary distribution of lineages:
    - where bias is downwind
    - where bias is "downhill" on a landscape with two mountains
4. summarize something as a function of bias strength. ideas:
    - genetic diversity
    - differentiation between the two mountains
5. other ideas
    - PCA plot for two mountains
